# Project 2: Landing Page

I created a sample website template by creating the boilerplate for HTML and adding a stylesheet. The css is heavily dependent on flexbox and the following html tags were used:

1. HTML
- `div`
- `ul`, `li`

2. CSS
- `display: flex`
- `flex-direction: column`
- `flex`
- `gap`
- `margin`
- `padding`
- `justify-content`
- `align-items`
- font-related shorthands
